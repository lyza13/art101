			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>Hi! I'm Lyza Stevens (she/her) and I am a 3rd year AGPM major at UC Santa Cruz. I've always been quite passionate about art and as I've gained an interest in technology and games over the years, my path towards the AGPM major fell right into place. Outside of school, I really enjoy drawing, oil painting, cooking, watching anime, and playing video games. I have some knowledge in Python and am pretty tech savvy. But I would definitely have to say my knowledge mostly resides in artistic applications, like Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Procreate, Illustrator, and After Effects. (Hoping to add softwares like Blender the the list eventually soon too!) I can't wait to learn how to fuse my skills in art with future knowledge of programming, modeling, and animation to make my artistic ideas come to life.</p>
