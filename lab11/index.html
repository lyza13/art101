		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p> With proper knowledge of buttons and jQuery, this lab posed little challenge. We did not encounter any issues getting our code to work as we intended, though the lab instructions were a challenge to interpret instead.</p>

		<div id="problems" class="section">
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Our only problem was that the instructions were unclear, and much of the instructions were not actionable without the context given by the professor's website source code for this lab. For example, "Toggle a class special within the div of the section" is not adequately clear without knowing what "class special" is, and this lab certainly does not explain what it is. We overcame these poor instructions by analyzing the professor's website source code and deriving a solution from there. Our problems with this lab would have been nonexistent if the assignment instructions were constructed to be as effective of a teaching tool as the class lectures.</p>
