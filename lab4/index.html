		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> The most challenging part of this lab was trying to interpret half of the instructions for the lab. For example, "Add any images to the images folder", was rather confusing considering that this lab did not call for any images to made or used, except for the screenshot which was requested after this particular instruction. Said screenshot would be completely redundant to include in the webpage, as the screenshot is one of the webpage itself. It was also a challenge to get this lab done in just two days time, considering that we are busy students and previous assignments allowed us at least 5 days.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> We had problems deciding on which tasks to choose to psuedocode, as well as problems interpreting the somewhat vague instructions present at several points during the assignment. As there are a potentially infinite number of tasks to psuedocode, narrowing it down to a PB&J and Minecraft took some effort. We also had a problem with the mandated headers for these paragraphs, as "Challenges" and "Problems" are extremely similar in meaning, yet the lab instructions did not offer any context for their use. Furthermore, the lab did not state that we had to fill these "Challenges" and "Problems", but we took a guess and decided that it was implied. The actual psuedocoding and copy pasting of the psuedo code into our index and js file were the easiest parts of the lab, despite being the learning goal of the lab. This also can be considered a problem.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> This is what we made, despite our confusion.<br><br>
				Make a PB&J sandwich:<br>
				1. Locate sliced bread, peanut butter, jelly, and butter knife<br>
				2. Acquire sliced bread, peanut butter, jelly, and butter knife<br>
				3. Move PB&J materials to nearest clean and flat kitchen countertop<br>
				4. Lay 2 slices of bread on countertop<br>
				5. Use butter knife to scoop peanut butter onto one bread slice, and jelly onto the other bread slice<br>
				6. Use butter knife again to evenly spread peanut butter and jelly onto their respective bread slices<br>
				7. Place the bread slice with jelly on it squarely on top of the bread slice with peanut butter on it, with the jelly side facing down.<br>
				8. Move PB&J materials into storage<br>
				9. Enjoy the PB&J sandwich<br><br>
				Build a wooden house in Minecraft:<br>
				1. Locate trees<br>
				2. Chop trees to acquire wood logs<br>
				3. Turn wood logs into wood planks in crafting menu<br>
					a. Return oak planks to inventory <br>
				4. Determine location to build the house<br>
				5. Plan out house shape, layout, and size<br>
				6. Place wood planks to create the planned house<br>
					a. If you do not have enough wooden planks to complete the house, repeat steps 1-3<br>
				7. Lose the house to a creeper explosion<br>
				8. Repeat<br>
