				<p> The instructions for Task 4 were somewhat unclear. The assignment instructions do not specify what section it is referring to when it states that "Give the section a title using the comicObj.title key from the object". It is also confusing as to why the instructions state "Give the image an alt and title attributes using the comicObj.alt key from the object" given that the alt and title attributes are separate things. Should the alt and title be the same? Why have these in the first attributes in the first place?</p>
