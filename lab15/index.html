			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p> The lab was relatively easy for us, and our only real challenge was trying to understand the assignment instructions.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="problems">
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> The task 2 instructions lack important context. Task 2 instructs you to "go to the docs for your API and pick an endpoint", but it does not explain what your API is in this context, and there is no other instruction in the assignment directing us to choose an API. Furthermore, it does not explain what testing the endpoint in our browser actually entails, so we had to guess. We resolved the issue by looking at the lecture recording and selecting a function for the numbersapi website, made our best guess as to what we should do next, and moved on from there to complete Task 2. </p>
