		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> There was little challenge to the lab assignment. The javascript coding was elementary and every other task undertaken completed was things we have done before multiple times.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> We did however encounter one issue where we for whatever strange reason couldn't get the script output working on Lyza's end. We resolved the issue by just copying and pasting everything over on Logan's end to Lyza's, and it solved whatever invisible issue there was.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>You are looking at the index.html file we created. Here is the program execution:</p>
			<h3>Script Output</h3>
			<div class=output>
				<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab5.js"></script>
			</div>
