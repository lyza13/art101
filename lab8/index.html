		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> There was little challenge to the lab for us overall. While anonymous functions were new, they're pretty easy to understand, though we're not sure why you would use them over a regular function. As for callbacks, with our previous programming experience the idea of using a function as input for another function is nothing new, and easy to do in this context.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> Our only problems were with working on the bonus tasks. Figuring out how to implement the javascript output in the web page bonus task took a fair amount of time and study. We couldnt get anything to show on webpage until we figured out that we needed to use the defer keyword. Then we figured out how to get our map results to display by cramming the stuff we did in the console into a string and displaying it with .innerHTML as the bonus task described.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p> Our results are visible in the console, as well as right below.</p>
